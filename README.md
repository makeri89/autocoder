## Features

With this extension you can get rid of imposter syndrome with ease!

## Usage

First, install this extension.

Create a folder named `ip-data` in the root directory of your project. Copy or create a file into that directory that you want to use later to write another file from.

Open an empty file, open the command palette with `ctrl+shift+p` and find a command `imposter: Start coding` and run it by pressing `Enter`.

It will prompt you to enter a file name you want to use, enter a name of a file inside the `ip-data` directory and start typing!
